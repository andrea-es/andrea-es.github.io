    <!-- Intro -->
    <p>
      Here are some fragments of my thoughts. Sometimes I feel the urge to put some reflections in writing, and for some reason I feel like putting them here. They're not really meant for anyone's reading except my own. Don't take them too seriously.
    </p>

    <h1>Noumenon</h1>
    <p><em>1/31/2025</em></p>
    <p>The world that we perceive is a creation of the mind. The mind decides that a table is a table, when in reality there's only at best a patterned distribution of molecules.</p>
    <p>Imagine perceiving the raw input of your senses before the mind orders them. Imagine seeing the almost infinite parts (atoms) that compose everything around you, and being unable to say this is a table, because in fact there's no table there. Imagine losing the notion of space and time (also a creation of the mind). Imagine being deprived of the capacity of structuring and simplifying information.</p>
    <p>Terrifying, and this is just the raw input before the mind alters it, but still mediated by the senses. The thing itself, the noumenon, could be infinitely weirder.</p>
    <p>Our perception of reality is only meant to <em>navigate</em> reality in a way that is functional for our survival. If that veil came off, would we go insane? We live in an illusion, and maybe it's good that we do.</p>

    <h1>S'i fosse foco</h1>
    <p><em>1/27/2025</em></p>
    <p>Two days ago I went to IKEA.</p>
    <p>I experienced a mild sense of pleasure at the comfort of the consumeristic life, and it disgusted me.</p>
    <p>Where's the wind of the storm, the fire of the thunder, the raw intensity of all-consuming love and of the struggle between life and death.</p>
    <p>I'd sooner burn the world to ashes than settle down in a life without struggle.</p>
    <p>That's why I can't be happy.</p>


    
    <h1>I'm lost… but it's ok</h1>
    <p><em>1/19/2025</em></p>
    <p>I'm just starting now to see and acknowledge the impact that the breakup had on me. I'm shaken in my very foundations, in ways that are not trivial.</p>
    <p>My physical and mental health have been failing me. I can't sleep well, I get sick easily, and I've been obsessing over things that won't fix me, although they might seem like they do.</p>
    <p>It's not as simple as missing her, although I do. I'm lost, and I feel like my older self is no longer sufficient for what will come next. I might be going through a major phase shift. I know I have to be careful.</p>
    <p>It's possible that when this transition is over I'll realize that the problems I had with her were problems with myself. It's also possible I'll realize none of it was all that special. There's no way to know it now.</p>
    <p>I should cherish every moment that I don't spend in my head, every moment of physical health, every laughter with a friend, every flash of hope. And yet I must not shy away from the challenge, find a local optimum and settle. I need to welcome the opportunity and embrace the change. Awareness is key.</p>
    <p>Exploring is a necessary part of the process, even when it leads to nowhere and I feel like I'm lower than the point I started at. Action produces information. Action produces information.</p>

    
    <h1>The road</h1>
    <p><em>1/18/2025</em></p>
    <p>I'm in Milan, in a car with a full tank and nowhere in the world to be. And still, I'd rather drive than face anything I could meet here, challenge or possibility. All my life I've been running, cause staying would mean taking something broken and fixing it, and starting anew is much easier.</p>
    <p>All my life I've been running, but I'm starting to run out of places to run to. Is it time to sail back to Ithaca already?</p>


    <h1>The flow</h1>
    <p><em>08/01/2024</em></p>
    <p>There’s no point in getting angry at the rain, or more in general at the events you cannot control. Just accept what comes, and if unpleasant reactions (anger, sadness) bubble up, reflect on what you could have done differently, then let it go. </p>
    <p>You should have agency, but work with the flow of reality, not against it. Get a sense of when you can adjust the flow of events (and do it!) but don’t try to stop the river. There’s no point, it’s a waste of energy.</p>
    <p>Going with the flow doesn’t mean don’t change anything, or be complacent with how things are. Sometimes opportunities arise to make a dent in the universe, and those should be embraced with full intentionality. Reality can be so different from what it has always been that it would seem like another universe. Learn to sense the winds of change when they come, and act accordingly.</p>



    <h1>Book: Way of the Peaceful Warrior</h1>
    <p><em>07/24/2024</em></p>
    <p>Yesterday I started to read this book, lent to me by my good friend Fisher. It’s been so incredibly refreshing. I’m longing for a spiritual dimension in my life, I just realized it. Whether it’s meditation, yoga, prayer, … I need to create some space for that to live fully. That’s what I need to calm the restlessness.</p>
    <p>Cause it’s true, there’s so much about wisdom that can’t be found in knowledge. The book talks about body wisdom, and the difference between ingesting knowledge and enacting wisdom.</p>
    <p>From the book:</p>
    <p><em>Use whatever knowledge you have but see its limitations. Knowledge alone does not suffice; it has no heart. No amount of knowledge will nourish or sustain your spirit; it can never bring you ultimate happiness or peace. <u>Life requires more than knowledge; it requires intense feeling and constant energy. Life demands right action if knowledge is to come alive.</u></em></p>
    <p>So true.</p>



    <h1>Rome and San Francisco</h1>
    <p><em>06/21/2024</em></p>
    <p>There’s a story called Zhuangzi, about a man who fell asleep one day and dreamed that he was a butterfly. When he woke up he did not know whether he was a man who had dreamed he was a butterfly or whether he was a butterfly now dreaming he was a man. The cognitive dissonance between Rome and San Francisco is so strong it makes me wonder which one is real life, and which is a dream.</p>
    <p>Rome is eternal, hence immutable. Every change is an illusion. Everything must change for everything to remain the same. San Francisco is the opposite. Its bursts of creativity irradiate and change the world, but they’re counterweighted by a tendency towards a cyberpunk nightmare and a drug addiction apocalypse.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it makes me feel lonely and alienated.</p>
    <p>Is it a necessary price for progress?</p>


    <h1>On technology</h1>
    <p><em>6/17/2024</em></p>
    <p>I think the value of a man is proportional to the amount of good that the reverberations of his actions bring to his household, community, and humanity. </p>
    <p>I chose technology as my professional field because I believe that enhancing humanity’s capabilities is the most impactful way to spend one’s life in our modern world.</p>
    <p>I believe in giving humanity the tools to do more, vastly more, with less. I believe that a 1 trillion plus population of immortal human beings colonizing galaxies is a good thing, and that the dreams of a *happy de-growth* are apocalyptical nightmares.</p>
    <p>The hypothesis according to which technology is intrinsically good morally was definitely buried in the 20th century by the atrocities committed in Europe by Nazi Germany, the most technologically advanced society of that time. However, restricting technological growth is not the solution. It’s up to the people to ensure that this ever-increasing power is harnessed in the most beneficial direction for humanity.</p>


    <h1>Life and death</h1>
    <p><em>6/13/2024</em></p>
    <p>This week I hopped on a plane and came to Rome.</p>
    <p>My 6-month old nephew was visiting and my 90-years old grandma was dying.</p>
    <p>Life and death.</p>
    <p>Worth being here in person.</p>
    <p>Nothing is more important than family at the end of the day.</p>
    <p>No one knew I was going. It was a most welcome surprise. I am happy I brought them joy. So happy.</p>
    <p>I am grateful for life. I am grateful for health. I am grateful for love. I am grateful that the amount of suffering I am subject to is bearable. I am grateful for the strength to bear it.</p>
    <p>I slept next to my dying grandma. It wasn’t pleasant. I fed her strawberries with zabaione. It was incredible. I reminded her about the good times. She nodded, but her pain was too great to smile.</p>
    <p>I cuddled my nephew. She is chubby, expressive, curious and fun. She smiles, cries, gets mad, but mostly she is curious. Her mom taking her in her arms always made her happy.</p>
