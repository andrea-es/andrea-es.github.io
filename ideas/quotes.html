    <h1>Ode</h1>
    <p><em>By Arthur O'Shaughnessy</em></p>
    <p>We are the music makers,<br>
    And we are the dreamers of dreams,<br>
    Wandering by lone sea-breakers,<br>
    And sitting by desolate streams; —<br>
    World-losers and world-forsakers,<br>
    On whom the pale moon gleams:<br>
    Yet we are the movers and shakers<br>
    Of the world for ever, it seems.</p>
    <p>With wonderful deathless ditties<br>
    We build up the world's great cities,<br>
    And out of a fabulous story<br>
    We fashion an empire's glory:<br>
    One man with a dream, at pleasure,<br>
    Shall go forth and conquer a crown;<br>
    And three with a new song's measure<br>
    Can trample a kingdom down.</p>

    <h1>On lying to oneself</h1>
    <p><em>By Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov</em></p>
    <p>Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.</p>

    
    <h1>Manifesto of Futurism</h1>
    <p><em>By Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</em></p>
    <p>We intend to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness.<br>
    Courage, audacity, and revolt will be essential elements of our poetry.</p>
    <p>Up to now literature has exalted a pensive immobility, ecstasy, and sleep. We intend to exalt aggressive action, a feverish insomnia, the racer's stride, the mortal leap, the punch and the slap.</p>
    <p>We affirm that the world's magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath—a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.</p>
    <p>We want to hymn the man at the wheel, who hurls the lance of his spirit across the Earth, along the circle of its orbit.</p>
    <p>The poet must spend himself with ardor, splendor, and generosity, to swell the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.</p>
    <p>Except in struggle, there is no more beauty. No work without an aggressive character can be a masterpiece. Poetry must be conceived as a violent attack on unknown forces, to reduce and prostrate them before man.</p>
    <p>We stand on the last promontory of the centuries!… Why should we look back, when what we want is to break down the mysterious doors of the Impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, because we have created eternal, omnipresent speed.</p>

    <h1>Wish you were here</h1>
    <p><em>By Pink Floyd</em></p>
    <p>So, so you think you can tell<br>
    Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?<br>
    Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?<br>
    A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?</p>
    <p>Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?<br>
    Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
    Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange<br>
    A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic">Song</a></p>
    
    <h1>If</h1>
    <p><em>By Rudyard Kipling</em></p>
    <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too;</p>

    <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>

    <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;</p>

    <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</p>

    <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
    Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</p>

    <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
    With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,</p>

    <p>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
    And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!</p>
