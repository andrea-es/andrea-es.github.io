    <h1>Jordan Peterson - Psychological Significance of Biblical Stories</h1>

    <h3>What is the Bible?</h3>

    <p>It is a collection of stories created, transmitted, and remembered over a vast stretch of time. These stories condense collective behavioral, interpersonal, and imaginative wisdom.</p>

    <p>It’s a guide on dealing with the tragedy of discovering self-awareness (knowing your own finiteness and vulnerability).</p>

    <p><strong>Old testament:</strong> Organize into a State (Israel) and serve God, the greater good. Through the old testament this State rises, develops/shows its pathologies and falls, over and over. Morale: there are infinite ways to fuck up, and many are displayed here. Don’t fuck up, or you’ll be punished.</p>

    <p><strong>New testament (Christian revolution):</strong> the place of salvation is not the state but the individual, and it comes from speaking the truth.</p>

    <p>Refers back to Genesis 1 (Creation): God speaks the world into being. What’s spoken into being through truth is good, and it takes the whole bible to rediscover. Mankind is made in the image of God because it’s the only creature that is capable of expanding creation through truth.</p>

    <p>(This last paragraph is somewhat unclear: revisit).</p>

    <h3>What is Creation?</h3>

    <p>It's a cataclysmic event at the beginning of times. Not the Big Bang, but the emergence of consciousness and self-awareness (the realization of our own mortality). From a human perspective, this emergence of consciousness is indeed a cataclysmic event, comparable to the Big Bang in importance. Viewing consciousness as insignificant in the cosmos is a nihilistic attitude. If consciousness means nothing, what’s the reason for living? The obvious consequence is suicide.</p>

    <h3>Common critiques to Religion</h3>

    <p><strong>Religion as desire for infant comfort:</strong> Hell doesn’t seem comforting at all.</p>

    <p><strong>Religion as an opium of the masses (a tool for power):</strong> the lust and fight for power are typical of the degeneration of any human organization and not only religion. Look at the atheist communist regimes of the 20th century: Marx has killed more people than God in the bible, or at least gets close.</p>
