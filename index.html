  <p>I created this website because I wanted to try some web development. 
    It doesn't have a specific purpose. It's just my corner on the Internet for sharing some thoughts. 
    I hope you like it. If not, I'll live with it.</p>
  
    <h2 id="about">Main quest</h2>

<p>My name is Andrea. I was born and raised in Rome, Italy, and currently live in Palo Alto, California. I have 3 beautiful sisters (Fosca, Gea, Assia) which are much smarter than me, and a dog (Zeno) which is much cuter. All my family lives in Italy.</p>
<p>In California, I am building Tesla's humanoid robot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_(robot)">Optimus</a>. I coordinate the mechanical design team's work on the hand of the robot, helping improve dexterity, reliability, and manufacturability of the bot in the effort of transforming it from a lab prototype to a mass manufacturable world-changing product. Before joining the Optimus team, I worked on the development of some of Tesla's core charging technologies (<a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1847302296494915588">Wireless Charging</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TeslaCharging/status/1857133110930063398">Supercharging</a>), accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles and enabling autonomous charging for self-driving cars.</p>
<p>I have a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering from the Polytechnic of Turin and a MS in Industrial Engineering (Supply Chain Management) from MIT. Before MIT, I worked at GE Aerospace, where I graduated from a rotational program in manufacturing (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT3ei9fYtqU">OMLP</a>) and worked in production management, manufacturing engineering, and process improvement.</p>
<p>I am passionate about the creation of new technology. I measure a man’s worth by how positively he impacts society and future generations, and I think in this day and age building new technology is a good way to maximize such impact.</p>

<h3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h3>

<p>I’ve been practicing martial arts (Boxing, Muay Thai) since I was 16 years old, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu since 2016. Jiu Jitsu clicked because on top of being extremely effective, it’s the martial art where pattern recognition and problem solving count the most, hence the best suited for a nerd like me.</p>

  <p>Jiu Jitsu taught me a lot about myself and about life. What counts on the mat is the hours you’ve put into training, your creativity, and the strength of your will. You can’t bullshit your way into tapping a good opponent, and the feedback for mistakes is immediate and painful.</p>
  
  <p>When I first joined MIT, the school did not have a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club. I barely had money for college and couldn't afford a gym membership, so I decided to start one. In a short amount of time, the club exploded beyond my wildest expectations, and when I left MIT it counted 5 instructors hosting daily classes and a lot of engagement from the MIT community, including MIT researcher and podcast host Lex Fridman.</p> 
   
  <p>The <a href="www.instagram.com/mitbjjclub">club</a> still runs today with new instructors and students, continuing the mission of providing relief from physical activity issues, stress and depression, which are way too common in the school, while training nerd assassins.</p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I recently learned that MIT has a jiu jitsu club. I stopped by to train and loved it.

<h3>Mentorship</h3>
<p>In the last few years, I’ve found fulfillment in helping STEM students and recent graduates with the struggle of deciding what to do with their future. I don’t claim to know much about anything in life, nor that my path is one they should follow, but I’ve learned a thing or two about choices that felt terrifying at the time. If sharing my experience with people who can relate helps even one of them find the courage to make a scary leap, that’s effort well spent.</p>

<p>I mostly offer this kind of mentorship in person, through the <a href="https://www.siliconvalleyfellowship.com/">Silicon Valley Fellowship</a>, but not exclusively. If you think I can help you in any way, send me an email or reach out on LinkedIn. If I don't respond, please understand that I work a lot, and it's often hard to carve out the time. It helps if your message is clear, well-written, and inspiring. I'm not saying you need to craft the perfect email to get my attention (I'm a nobody), but being able to express what you think and feel in writing is a killer skill to develop.</p>
